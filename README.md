# A repository for reinforcement learning exploration and development.  
  
## Purpose  
The development of this repository is intended to explore modern reinforcement learning algorithms  
using gymnasium environments, including gymnasium robotics environments:  
  
[Gymnasium: https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html)  
[Robotics: https://robotics.farama.org/index.html](https://robotics.farama.org/index.html)  
  
> - Developed using Visual Studio for managing projects and debugging code.  
> - Tensorboard is used for tracking model metrics during training,  
> graph visualization, and presenting environment renderings.  
> - Pytorch is used for building neural network modules.  
> - The control GUI is written using Kivy.  
> - Environments are managed using Anaconda.  
  
Aditional algorithms will be added over time and new research will be integrated as  
it becomes available and necessary.  
  
## Useage  
  
Development with Visual Studio is encouraged as that is what has been used so far.  
> **If running in a Windows environment use Python version 3.10.13 in a fresh Conda environment!**  
> Tensorflow stopped being supported in Windows environements some time ago  
> Using Anaconda to create an environment running Pythong version 3.10.13 will ensure  
> that other dependencies will install properly and run without conflict.  
  
### The following packages should be installed:  
 - Pytorch  
 - Tensorflow (For using Tensorboard.)  
 - Gymnasium  
 - Gymnasium-robotics  
 - Dill  (Operates on top of Pickle for more complex types.)  
 - OpenCV (For processing video files.)  
 - Pygame (Required for some Gymnasium environments.)  
 - Kivy  
  
## Execution  

To Be Updated  

## Generated Content  

Pickle files, Tensorboard logging data, and test sequence video files are saved in the project  
directory by default using a date and time naming convention.
